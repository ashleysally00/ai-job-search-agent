# AI Job Search Agent

An automated job search tool that scans multiple job boards daily for AI-related positions including Prompt Engineering, AI UX, Content Engineering, and AI Content Writing roles.

## Why I Built This

I wanted to optimize my job search. This agent searches 50+ company career pages daily so I can focus on applications and networking.

**Key insight from the job market**: Companies are increasingly looking for "AI managers" - professionals who can direct and orchestrate AI agents. This tool helps you find those emerging roles.

## Status
